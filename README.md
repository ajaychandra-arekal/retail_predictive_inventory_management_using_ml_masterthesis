Predictive Inventory Management for Retail Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This repository hosts the code and resources for the Master’s Thesis: Predictive Inventory Management for Retail Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques. The project explores and implements various machine learning models to forecast sales and optimize inventory levels in retail environments.

Project Overview

Efficient inventory management is critical in retail to balance between stock shortages and excess holding costs. Traditional inventory methods have limitations in adapting to dynamic and fluctuating market demands. This project leverages machine learning models to accurately predict demand and optimize stock levels, particularly during high-demand periods such as holidays and promotional events.

The thesis implements and evaluates predictive models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, proposing a hybrid model approach to improve forecast accuracy and reduce inventory holding costs.

Features

	•	Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and outlier removal to enhance data quality.
	•	Feature Engineering: Converts seasonal variables, creates lag variables, and encodes categorical variables to improve model performance.
	•	Model Development and Comparison: Implements ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to forecast retail demand.
	•	Visualization Dashboards: Uses Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing inventory levels, sales trends, and forecasted demand.

Results

Model performance comparison (as per the thesis analysis) shows:

	•	Prophet performed well for seasonal trend capturing.
	•	Random Forest and Gradient Boosting provided robust predictions with lower error margins during high-demand periods.
	•	Hybrid Model combined the strengths of individual models, leading to improved accuracy across product categories.

Future Enhancements

	•	Integration with real-time data streams for dynamic inventory updates.
	•	Exploration of deep learning models, including LSTMs, for capturing complex temporal dependencies.
	•	Advanced hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
